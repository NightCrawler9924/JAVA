# 📘 Java Learning Repository – Code + Custom Notes

Welcome to my Java learning repository! This repo contains all the Java programs and **custom notes** I wrote while learning the language. My aim was to deeply understand each topic - so the notes are not generic copy-paste but simplified in **my own words**, with **diagrams**, **examples**, and **use cases** where needed.
